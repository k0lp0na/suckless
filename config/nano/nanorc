## Paint the interface elements of nano.  These are examples; there are
## no colors by default, except for errorcolor and spotlightcolor.

set stripecolor grey,grey
set numbercolor white

#set titlecolor bold,black,white

#set promptcolor lightwhite,grey
#set statuscolor bold,grey,green
# set errorcolor bold,white,red
# set spotlightcolor black,lightyellow
#set selectedcolor lightwhite,grey
# set scrollercolor cyan
# set keycolor cyan
# set functioncolor green

## In root's .nanorc you might want to use:
# set titlecolor bold,white,magenta
#set promptcolor black,yellow
#set statuscolor bold,white,magenta
# set errorcolor bold,white,red
# set spotlightcolor black,orange
# set selectedcolor lightwhite,cyan
#set stripecolor ,grey
# set scrollercolor magenta
#set numbercolor magenta
# set keycolor lightmagenta
# set functioncolor magenta

## === Key bindings ===
## For all details, see 'man nanorc', section REBINDING KEYS.

## If you want to suspend nano with one keystroke (instead of with ^T^Z):

## The <Ctrl+Delete> keystroke deletes the word to the right of the cursor.
## On some terminals the <Ctrl+Backspace> keystroke produces ^H, which is
## the ASCII character for backspace, so it is bound by default to the
## backspace function.  The <Backspace> key itself produces a different
## keycode, which is hard-bound to the backspace function.  So, if you
## normally use <Backspace> for backspacing and not ^H, you can make
## <Ctrl+Backspace> delete the word to the left of the cursor with:
# bind ^H chopwordleft main

## For a more mnemonic Comment keystroke (overriding Cut-from-cursor):
# bind M-K comment main

## If you want ^L to just refresh the screen and not center the cursor:
# bind ^L refresh main

## When you sometimes type M-J instead of M-K, or M-T instead of M-R:
# unbind M-J main
# unbind M-T main
## (Those functions are still accessible through ^T^J and ^T^V.)

## For quickly uppercasing or lowercasing the word under or after the cursor.
## (These effectively select a word and pipe it through a sed command.)
# bind Sh-M-U "{nextword}{mark}{prevword}{execute}|sed 's/.*/\U&/'{enter}" main
# bind Sh-M-L "{nextword}{mark}{prevword}{execute}|sed 's/.*/\L&/'{enter}" main

## For copying a marked region to the system clipboard:
# bind Sh-M-C "{execute}|xsel -ib{enter}{undo}" main

## For normalizing Unicode to precomposed characters:
# bind Sh-M-N "{execute}| uconv -x nfc {enter}" main

## For snipping trailing blanks when you save a file:
# bind ^S "{execute}| sed 's/\s\+$//' {enter}{savefile}" main

## If you would like nano to have keybindings that are more "usual",
## such as ^O for Open, ^F for Find, ^H for Help, and ^Q for Quit,
## then uncomment these:
# bind ^X cut main
# bind ^C copy main
# bind ^V paste all
# bind ^Q exit all
# bind ^S savefile main
# bind ^W writeout main
# bind ^O insert main
# set multibuffer
# bind ^H help all
# bind ^H exit help
# bind ^F whereis all
# bind ^G findnext all
# bind ^B wherewas all
# bind ^D findprevious all
# bind ^R replace main
# unbind ^U all
# unbind ^N main
# unbind ^Y all
# unbind M-J main
# unbind M-T main
# bind ^A mark main
# bind ^P location main
# bind ^T gotoline main
# bind ^T gotodir browser
# bind ^T cutrestoffile execute
# bind ^L linter execute
# bind ^E execute main
# bind ^K "{mark}{end}{zap}" main
# bind ^U "{mark}{home}{zap}" main
# bind ^Z undo main
# bind ^Y redo main
